This is my website for Comm150, "Introduction to New Media."

It consists of three assignments: 
- **7B:** practicing website layouts by recreating a given recipe page
- **7C:** creating Web Art that expresses a message (mine focuses on the lack of privacy on the web)
- **8A:** creating a Twine game that has meaning (mine attempts to place emphasis on the environment and how daily activities that we don't think about can actually cause harm)
