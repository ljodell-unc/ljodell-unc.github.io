        <p id="text">Back in March, during those first terrifying weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, 
            I started writing a series of 
            articles as a way to help cooks figure out how 
            to use the mountain of beans and pasta many of us had manically 
            laid in, in case we couldn’t, or didn’t feel comfortable, leaving the house.</p>

        <p id="text">Called From the Pantry, it was intended to provide recipes that were versatile 
            enough to cut down on anxiety-ridden trips to the supermarket, while still being 
            satisfying to eat and calming to cook. The recipes, written narratively, were a 
            real-time kitchen diary, based on what I had in my own pantry, and created with 
            an eye toward giving readers wiggle room to use what was in theirs.</p>
